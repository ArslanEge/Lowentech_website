    <!-- Description -->
    <p class="text-base sm:text-lg font-normal text-text-gray mb-6 text-center sm:text-left leading-relaxed">
      Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, Pass Guard seeks to eliminate the need for physical cards within certain organizations, 
      offering a more sustainable and user-friendly solution. For each transaction, it necessitates face-scanning for user identification, 
      performing a real-time analysis of the user conducting the transaction, and cross-referencing this with the corresponding user profile stored in its database. 
      Rather than solely relying on NFC technology, Pass Guard is equipped to execute operations within the organization via QR code scanning. 
      Beyond facilitating access events, Pass Guard also provides a blockchain-powered feature enabling users to transfer funds either 
      peer-to-peer or to in-house stores.
